# Bike Trip Analysis of the New York City bike-sharing program

New York City and Des Moines have two different city dynamics. The center of New York City is crowded by tourists, workers, artists, students, and families. Des Moines, with 216,000 inhabitants, is a really small city in comparison with New York and its population of 8,800,000. However, we will prove that a bike sharing program is sustainable for the city of Des Moines because the majority of the activity do not rely on the tourism dynamic. 
This document will present our bike trip analysis with data provided for the month of August.

## 1. A bike sharing program widely supported by the subscribers activity

In August 2019, the New York bike sharing program registered 2,344,224 bike rentals. With 1,900,359 rentals made by subscribers, 81% of the NYC program is supported by the subscribers. We are able to conclude that, even for a touristic city like New York, this kind of activity is mainly directed to usual users.

We also highlight that the main users are male. 65% of the bike sharing is done by male, only 25% are done by female.

## 2. Short trips during rush hours

The average trip length is 10 minutes. In a big city like New York, we can suppose that the main users are people who leaves in New York and uses the bike sharing to go from the subway to their work, or from their home to their work. The main usage for the bike sharing is not leisure. Bike sharing is practical in order to move from one point to another for our day to day life.

Our conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of the trips by weekday and per hour. The rush hours for bike sharing is between 7 and 9 am and 5 to 7 pm.

## 3. An activity concentrated in the heart of Manhattan

The bike sharing activity in New York city is concentrated in Manhattan. Manhattan is the leading center of banking, finance, and communication in the United States and is the location of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Wall Street. Many of the world's largest corporations locate their home offices in Manhattan.

The August bike sharing activity in Manhattan is also supported by the touristic activity, even if we have already demonstrated above that the main activity for the bike sharing is related to subscribers.

## 4. The male population is your main target

The male population is your main target. Even if their trip length is the same that the female one, they are accounting for more than 3 quarter of the overall population who is using the bike sharing program.

If the male population is an intensive user of the bike sharing program, we advice you to have a high quality of services on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays where the  demand seems to be stonger.

## 5. An intense activity during rush hours and morning times available for bike maintenance

We have already highlighted above that the bike sharing activity is concentrated during the morning and afternoon rush hours. In order to optimize the activity during the day, we advice you to organize the bike maintenance during the morning hours, before 7am.

In order to help you set a high quality model, we provide a tool for you to be able to identify the bikes which are in need of maintenance.

## Conclusion

The bike sharing program in New York city is supported by subscribers who have a daily usage of the service. The activity is focused during the morning and afternoon rush hours, leaving enough time for the teams to organize the maintenance of the bikes. To support our conclusions, we would advice to analyze the zip code of the users in order to confirm that the main users of the service are people who leaves all year long in the city.

In order to have a service without any failure, we also would like to calculate, for each bike station, the difference between the number of bikes dropped off and picked up. We would be able to identify the bike stations with a deficit of bikes at the end of the day and those with too many bikes. The city will be able to organize whatever is needed in order to be able to provide the bike sharing service every day at every bike station.
